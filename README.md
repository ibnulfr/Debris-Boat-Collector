# Debris-Boat-Collector
Designed and built a semi-autonomous debris collection boat, modelled in MATLAB Simulink and deployed to an Arduino system. Tested in a 1.2 m × 1.2 m reservoir (250 mm depth), it successfully collected all 9 floating objects within the 10-minute limit, demonstrating stable control and effective integration.
